# Android-Web-Scraper
In this Android project, I've incorporated elements of basic Web Data mining, NLP (POS extraction) and Machine Learning (Clustering and Classification). 

I've devised a custom Article Sorting Algorithm, based on user preference(s).

The user can save articles of interests, which saves her preference(s) – essential topics extracted from the article – simultaneously. As and when new articles are scraped or the bookmarked ones are displayed, they are ranked (classified) according to their degree of match with these preferences.
